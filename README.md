1at assignment of EECS 730 machine learning - leaf class prediction and Breast cancer classification

Prerequisites Python 3.7.3, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Library, Numpy Library, matplotlib, and dearborn library

Introduction: In this project, we are going to use unsupervised learning using the data set of leaf classification and Breast cancer classification.Leaf data holds the information about classification of type of leaf on the basis of several attributes calculated on the basis of leaf's texture and dimensions. These attributes are 'Class (Species)','Specimen Number','Eccentricity','Aspect Ratio','Elongation', 'Solidity','Stochastic Convexity','Isoperimetric Factor','Maximal Indentation Depth','Lobedness','Average Intensity','Average Contrast','Smoothness','Third moment','Uniformity','Entropy'. Similarly, Breast cancer classification
Here

We are going to predict the class and type of leaf if the attribute values are given for a leaf. Using the relationship between mean and covariance with regard to euclidean distance between data points and centroids
